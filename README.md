Famous Tic Tae Toe game we have all played, but with an AI opponent.

I constructed this project to improve at Python and challenge myself by making a basic AI play against a human. To my surprise, it's difficult to beat!

How to Play
Ensure that you have already installed Python in your computer.

Save the code in a file called tictactoe.py.

Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux).

Go to the directory where you stored the file.

Execute the command: python tictactoe.py

When you get your turn, simply type a number from 1 to 9 to put your 'X' on the board.

Features

1-Classical Gameplay: A clean and simple 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.
2-Smart AI Opponent: Play against a thinking computer. The computer will try to beat you, and it will block if you are about to win.
3-Terminal-Based: No use for flashy graphics here! It executes right in your command line, so it's an excellent example of pure programming logic.

What I Learned From This Project

1-How to handle user input and create game loops in Python which is very fundamental.
2-The value of employing functions to maintain the code uncluttered and organized. 
3-How to think in terms of game logic, e.g., whether there is a winner or a draw. The basics of creating an algorithm for the AI's strategy, the highlight of the fun!
